# redbar
## Description
This is a "Moorhun" like game written in go with the [pixel](https://github.com/faiface/pixel) library.

## Motivation
Made for the Game off 2022, theme being "cliché". 
This builds on the cliché, that red barrels are always conveniently placed.
Basically you are the red barrel and have to move in the scope, so you are conveniently placed.

## Controls
- Press F to make the window fullscreen, press F again to make it windowed
- Press Q to quit
- Move your Cursor to move the Barrel

## TODO: 
- [ ] compile binary for Windows
- [ ] add in-game control-explanation
